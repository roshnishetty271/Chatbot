Flow Diagram:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a61f8b41-be88-4f00-a324-c3394745f8ea)


***Step 1: Patient Initiates the Appointment Booking Request (Frontend - Chatbot Interaction)***

Action: 

  • The patient opens the website and interacts with the chatbot. 
  
  • The chatbot greets the user and offers assistance (e.g., “Hello! How can I assist 
  you today?”). 
  
  • The patient types: "I want to book an appointment." 
  
Backend Trigger: 

  • Chatbot forwards message to the LLM Service 
  
  • LLM Service connects with the AI Model 
  
  • AI Model performs Intent Recognition and Entity Extraction 
  
    o Intent Recognition: Identifies "Appointment Booking" 
    
    o Entity Extraction: Checks for implicit information (e.g., "tomorrow" = date) 
    
    o AI model then sends the intent ("Appointment Booking") to Conversation Management 
    Module. 
    
***Step 2: Conversation Management Module (Backend) Conversation Manager Actions:***

1. Receives parsed intent/entities from AI Model.
   
2. Checks completeness using required fields:
   
      o Patient Name
    
      o Contact Info 
      
      o Preferred Date & Time 
      
      o Condition/Reason
      
      o Insurance Details
  
3. Maintains state machine with:
       
      o Session storage 
      
      o Context preservation 
  
The module will generate a response based on the intent and ask for the implicit information 
necessary from the user to proceed. 

***Step 3: Chatbot Gathers Patient Information (Frontend - Chatbot Interaction)***

The chatbot responds and collects the necessary details: 

  1. Patient Name: “Please enter your full name.”
      
  2. Email/Phone: “What is your email or phone number?”
     
  3. Preferred Date & Time: “When would you like your appointment?”
     
  4. Condition/Reason: “What is the reason for your visit?”
     
  5. Insurance Details: “Do you have insurance coverage?”
      
***Step 4: Backend Processes the Appointment Request (Backend - Business Logic Execution)***

Action: 

  • The Conversation Management Module sends the validated patient information to the 
  Appointment scheduling system. 
  
  • The Appointment Service checks availability in the database and verifies insurance eligibility via 
  API call to the insurance provider. 
  
Backend: 

Possible Outcomes: 
  
  1. Appointment Available → The system books the slot.
     
  2. No Slots Available → The chatbot asks the patient to choose another time.
     
  3. Insurance Issue → The chatbot notifies the patient and offers self-pay options.
     
Once an appointment is successfully booked, the backend: 
  
  1.Stores the appointment details in the Appointment Database.
  
  2.Sends a confirmation email/SMS to the patient. 
  
  3.Logs the booking event in the support ticketing system for reference. 
  
***Step 5: Chatbot Notifies the Patient (Frontend - Response to User)*** 

• The chatbot confirms the appointment booking: 

“Your appointment is confirmed for [Date] at [Time] with [Therapist]. You will 
receive an email/SMS confirmation shortly.” 

• If any issue occurs (no slots available, insurance denied), the chatbot offers 
solutions: 

“We couldn’t find an available slot. Would you like to try a different time?” 

“Your insurance is not supported. Would you like to proceed with self-pay?
